here is the case for the flow of data between temp table and clients table

the banker will get all the data inside the temp table in its dashboard
the banker will decide whether to accept or deny account open application
the banker will then write the national ID of the accepted client and
click a button that will send this data to clients table and save it there
and in the same time that data will be deleted from the temp database.
